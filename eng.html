Our upper secondary school is situated at Kalstad, a couple of kilometres 
from the centre of Kragerø. Here, a varied selection of education is 
offered, gathered together in a common school building and under a 
common administration. As a public school, it is owned by Telemark 
County Council. All together the school has 450 students distributed 
in eight lines of study. Some of these lines are primarily in 
preperation for vocational careers, while others are on the whole 
for further education. In the proximity of the school, you will 
find a residential area, in addition to recreation possibilities 
in the form of woodland paths and sports stadium, and sports centre - 
Kragerøhallen.
      <p align="justify"> The municipality of Krager&oslash; has from 10500 to 11000 
        inhabitants, a little over half of these living in the municiple centre 
        of the same name. Trade is varied with commerce and industry, primary 
        industry and tourism, and the extensive school offer must be seen in connection 
        with this. Krager&oslash;'s position between East and South Norway has 
        given the area a favorable climate with more sunny days and fewer rain-days 
        than the country's mean average. When this is combined with the beautiful 
        skerries, it is not difficult to understand why this otherwise sleepy 
        town experiences a few hectic sommer months every year. 
      <p align="justify">
On these pages, we don't just want to present the school's offer of education 
possibilities, but we also wish that the visitor gets insight into the whole 
school community. We wish to show some of the breadth which is a character of 
Krager&oslash; Upper Secondary School by presenting activities that make up 
part of the school day, and activities that break with it. As an example we 
present impressions from school exchanges with 
<a href="tyskutvt.html"><font color="#000066"><U><B>M&ouml;nchengladbach</B></U></font></a> 
in Germany and <a href="pasvalys.html"><font color="#000066"><U><B>Pasvalys</B></U></font></a> 
in Lithuania to illustrate that we take internationalisation seriously.
We have as a goal that these pages shall be a source of knowledge and information. 
Here, it will be possible for students, employees, parents and outsiders to find 
out where they can apply when they need help and advice, at the same time, there 
are links that radiate from the school. We shall, as far as possible, try to keep 
these pages updated.
